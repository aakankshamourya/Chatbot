Developed advanced contextual and knowledge-based chatbot solutions using GenAi LLM, effectively handling both unstructured and structured data. Integrated GenAi with Langchain to manage workflow orchestration, while interacting with a vast 10 GB of unstructured data. Conducted extensive prompt engineering & RAG techniques to optimize the system’s responsiveness and intelligence & deployed GenAi solutions on the client’s VM.& Implemented the streaming functionality like Chat GPT interface in solutions . Which helps the internal audience/employees to understand the Research data much better.


Objective: interact with the research data of Almarai , and find the relevant information quickly and accurately 


pipeline:

1: unstactured data

LangChain(memory, agent, tool,chain, vdb, prompt, LLM)


2: embedding (openai embedding)

    chunk size

3: vector database(faiss)/facebook 

   RAG Techniques(Knowledge base + prompt + user question)


Knowledge graph(vector search + RAG)


Similarity search (threshold level) to get the best accurate result

4: LLM model

5: prompte engineering


  1: greeting (hi ,hello),

6: relevance(top and latest result)

   verbosity (summary length)

7: citation generation and sorting latest to old

8: streaming capabilities

9: JSON output with HTML tags

10: endpoint(Rest api/flask): Request functionality like download, upload, delete

11: logging capabilities has been monitored at every stage(CI/CD)



Code automation with CI/CD pipeline
